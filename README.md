# Day of Week - Java Switch statement

Welcome to the Java Day of Week Switch repository! 
This repository contains a concise Java program (`Switch.java`) that showcases the power of the switch statement in determining the day of the week based on a given number input.

## Description

In this program, we demonstrate the elegance and efficiency of the switch statement by mapping numeric inputs to the corresponding days of the week. 
Each case in the switch statement represents a day of the week, providing a clear and intuitive way to handle multiple conditional branches.

## Usage

Follow these steps to run the program:

1. Ensure Java is installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the directory containing `Switch.java`.
4. Compile the Java file with the command:
5. Run the compiled program using:
6. Witness the simplicity and effectiveness of the switch statement as it accurately determines the day of the week based on the input number.
